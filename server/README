Welcome to the biographer server.

The server provides the web2py application to provide services for the 
biographer simulator. The service mainly used is the simulation of SBML
files using libscopes.
To use the server it can be copied to the web2py application directory.
But first we need to install the necessary dependencies and libraries.

Dependencies:
If you are using Ubuntu, install necessary dependences to run the server
and build the libraries:
    make deps
Otherwise please refer below for a list of dependencies:
    #gcc, make and other stuff
    build-essential
    #server application
    web2py
    #required to build libSBML
    libxml2-dev
    #required to build libscopes and libSBML python libs
    python-dev
    #optional: to ensure that the package can be uninstalled later
    checkinstall
    
Build libraries:
Fetch and build the libs by executing the command:
    make libs
The above commands adds the following libs:
    libscopes
    libSBML
If the libSBML build fails please refer to libSBML's documentation on
how to install.

Setup the server:
Create required directories by running the command given below:
    make
