Welcome to the biographer server.

The server provides the web2py application to provide services for the 
biographer simulator. The service mainly used is the simulation of SBML
files using libscopes.
To use the server it can be copied to the web2py applications directory.
But first we need to install the necessary dependencies and libraries.

Dependencies:
If you are using Ubuntu, install necessary dependences to run the server
and build the libraries:
    make deps
Otherwise please refer below for a list of dependencies:
    #gcc, make and other stuff
    build-essential
    #server application
    python-web2py
    #required to build libSBML
    libxml2-dev
    #required to build libscopes
    python-dev
    swig
    #optional: to ensure that the package can be uninstalled later
    checkinstall
Build libraries:
Install libsbml first as libscopes is dependent on it. Download it's 
latest source tar from:
    http://sourceforge.net/projects/sbml/files/libsbml
As building libSBML for every platform varies widely, here is a small 
set of commands to help you install it:
    tar -xzf libSBML-*-src.tar.gz
    cd libsbml-*
    ./configure --with-python
    make
    sudo checkinstall
Fetch and build libscopes by executing the command:
    make libscopes

Setup the server:
Create required directories by running the command given below:
    make
